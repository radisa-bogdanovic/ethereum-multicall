This is forked and updated version of https://www.npmjs.com/package/ethereum-multicall.
I added optional chainId in model constructor to evade unneeded request on node for that information.
This version work well with Web3 provider because i'm using that provider in my implementation of this libary and i created logic specificaly for that case.
This libary is ofc free for use and is just minor update from https://github.com/joshstevens19/ethereum-multicall. Big thanks for that guy.
